# About me
I'm an accountant learning Python, VBA, and PowerQuery 

As the field becomes more data-driven, I'm learning to code in order to: 

- Automate or script tedius repetitive tasks such as generating and formatting reports, data entry, preparation of templates for Journal Entries.

- Analyze data at scale; working with PowerQuery to get and transform data for input into BI tools such as Looker, PowerBI, or Tableu  

- Improve Accuracy and reproducability; the benefits of reproducible steps allow for a clear audit trail with minimal human input improve accuracy and reliability of entries.
